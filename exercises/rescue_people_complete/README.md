# RESCUE PEOPLE EXCERSISE

The intention of this practice is to implement the logic that allows a quadricopter
to reognize recognize lost people (faces of people) and save their position on 
the map, in order to perform a subsequent rescue maneuver.


## EXECUTION

Follow these simple steps to launch this practice:

1. In the first terminal launch gazebo as follows:

    `$ gazebo ArDrone_rescue-people.world`

2. Them, in other terminal launch the rescue people component:

    `$ python2 ./rescue_people.py rescue_people_conf.yml`


## How to do the practice

To carry out the practice, you must edit the `MyAlgorithm.py` file and insert 
the control logic into it.

## Where to insert the code

[MyAlgorithm.py](MyAlgorithm.py#L62)

```
    def execute(self):
         # Add your code here
         tmp = self.navdata.getNavData()
         if tmp is not None:
             print ("State: " +str(tmp.state))
             print ("Altitude: " +str(tmp.altd))
             print ("Vehicle: " +str(tmp.vehicle))
             print ("Battery %: " +str(tmp.batteryPercent))     
```

## API
* `self.camera.setThresholdImage()`: If you want show a black and white image.
* `self.camera.getImage().data`: returns the image captured by the active camera of the drone (frontal or ventral).
* `self.cmdvel.setVX(velx)`: set linear speed of the drone.
* `self.cmdvel.setVY(vely)`: set linear speed of the drone.
* `self.cmdvel.sendVelocities()`: send set velocities to the drone.
* `self.cmdvel.sendCMDVel(self,vx,vy,vz,ax,ay,az)`: sends linear and angular speed commands to the drone.
* `self.pose.getPose3d().x`, `self.pose.getPose3d().y`, `self.pose.getPose3d().z`: returns the position values ​​of the drone in space.
* `self.pose.getPose3d().roll`, `self.pose.getPose3d().pitch`, `self.pose.getPose3d().yaw`: returns the rotation values ​​of the drone in space.
* `self.extra.toggleCam()`: changes the drone's active camera (frontal or the one below).
* `self.extra.takeOff()`: Takeoff of the drone.
* `self.extra.land()`: landing of the drone.
