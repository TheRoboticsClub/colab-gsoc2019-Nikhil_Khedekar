title: Week 2 - Heights and models
---

## 1. The Height issue

So a big and noticable issue is that the PX4 does not hold its altitude when commanded a velocity in offboard mode (as illustrated in [this video by JdeRobot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3U_V2lc4LQ) and the video below)

(Click on the image for the video)

[![Unable to hold altitude](http://img.youtube.com/vi/wng4TO8XjqQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wng4TO8XjqQ "Height issue")

There are two methods for providing setpoints to the PX4 in SITL through MAVROS in the OFFBOARD mode. These are:

1. [SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#SET_POSITION_TARGET_LOCAL_NED)
2. [SET_ATTITUDE_TARGET](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#SET_ATTITUDE_TARGET)

{: .box-note}
**Note:** As mentioned [here](https://docs.px4.io/en/flight_modes/offboard.html), only 2 frames are allowed in the OFFBOARD mode: `MAV_FRAME_LOCAL_NED` and `MAV_FRAME_BODY_NED`

Both of these include a `type_mask` that can be set to pass only specific values through a [`mav_msgs/PositionTarget`](http://docs.ros.org/api/mavros_msgs/html/msg/PositionTarget.html) on the [`setpoint_raw/local`](http://wiki.ros.org/mavros#mavros.2BAC8-Plugins.setpoint_raw) topic. [This issue](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/issues/792#issuecomment-328018718) shows an example of the command to control the velocity. Building on this, I tested sending `vx`, `vy`,`az`, and `z` on `setpoint_raw/local` with the appropriately set `type_mask` and was able to get a consistent altitude (+-10% max). This also involved quite a bit of searching and to provide credit where it is due, following are the links that were the most helpful:
[\[1\]](http://answers.ros.org/question/251356/mavros-simultaneous-position-and-velocity-control/)
[\[2\]](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/issues/794)
[\[3\]](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/issues/402)
[\[4\]](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/issues/1074)
[\[5\]](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/issues/471)

Finally, I [modified DroneWrapper](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Nikhil_Khedekar/blob/master/catkin_ws/src/drone_exercises/src/drone_wrapper.py) to use `setpoint_raw` instead of the `setpoint_position` or `setpoint_velocity` which can now be commanded to move with any particular `vx`, `vy` and `az` to hold a given altitude (`z`). The altitude tracking is now only limited by the tuning of the PID values of the PX4 (as is evident in the video below).

**Note:** An issue related to this has been [raised on PX4/Firmware](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/issues/12206) and proposes to have a sort of position hold when the commanded velocity is 0. I shall incorporate this (i.e. `git pull`) once it is merged into `master`.

## 2. The fault in our models

Another task for this week was to figure out what was the issue in the model of the Iris that was causing PX4 and MAVROS to fail on launching `iris_1_roadtexturesROS.launch`.

{: .box-note}
**Note:** [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) is <3

The current JdeRobot-assets has the following changes from the PX4 SITL models:

1. (Major) `fpv_cam` does not exist in the JdeRobot-assets and is probably imported from the PX4 directories
2. (Major) `mavlink_tcp` not set or used
3. (Minor) Inertia values for the Iris are different (higher)
4. (Minor) `self_collision` tags not set
5. (Immaterial) Magnetometer and barometer not included in model
6. (Immaterial) Dronecode sdk ports not set
7. (Immaterial) `vision_estimation` set to `False`
8. (Immaterial) `lockstep` is disabled

The terminal dump itself revealed quite a few issues:

1. `px4.sh` file does not exist:

    ```bash
    ERROR: cannot launch node of type [mavros/px4.sh]: can't locate node [px4.sh] in package [mavros]
    ```

2. The textures for the house do not exist:

    ```bash
    [Err] [Material.cc:93] Unable to find texture[house_4/materials/Steel_Brushed_Stainless.png] in path[/opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/models/house_4/meshes]
    [Err] [Material.cc:93] Unable to find texture[house_4/materials/Wood_Veneer_01.png] in path[/opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/models/house_4/meshes]
    [Err] [Material.cc:93] Unable to find texture[house_4/materials/Brick_Antique_01.png] in path[/opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/models/house_4/meshes]
    [Err] [Material.cc:93] Unable to find texture[house_4/materials/Roofing_Tile_Spanish.png] in path[/opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/models/house_4/meshes]
    [Err] [Material.cc:93] Unable to find texture[house_4/materials/Blinds_Roman_Hobbled_Blue.png] in path[/opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/models/house_4/meshes]
    [Err] [Material.cc:93] Unable to find texture[house_4/materials/Translucent_Glass_Gold.png] in path[/opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/models/house_4/meshes]
    ```

3. Some unnecessary joints are instantiated? 

    ```bash
    [Dbg] [gazebo_mavlink_interface.cpp:135] <joint_name> not found for channel[0] no joint control will be performed for this channel.
    [Dbg] [gazebo_mavlink_interface.cpp:135] <joint_name> not found for channel[1] no joint control will be performed for this channel.
    [Dbg] [gazebo_mavlink_interface.cpp:135] <joint_name> not found for channel[2] no joint control will be performed for this channel.
    [Dbg] [gazebo_mavlink_interface.cpp:135] <joint_name> not found for channel[3] no joint control will be performed for this channel.
    [Wrn] [gazebo_mavlink_interface.cpp:124] joint [zephyr_delta_wing::propeller_joint] not found for channel[4] no joint control for this channel.
    [Wrn] [gazebo_mavlink_interface.cpp:124] joint [zephyr_delta_wing::flap_left_joint] not found for channel[5] no joint control for this channel.
    [Wrn] [gazebo_mavlink_interface.cpp:124] joint [zephyr_delta_wing::flap_right_joint] not found for channel[6] no joint control for this channel.
    [Dbg] [gazebo_mavlink_interface.cpp:135] <joint_name> not found for channel[7] no joint control will be performed for this channel.
    ```

4. **The instantiated FCU is unsupported by the autopilot version:**

    ```

Changes in the world files:

1. `grass_plane` used instead of `ground_plane` with mudboxes
2. House model changed (3 -> 4)
3. `iris_fpv_cam` inserted in place of `ArDrone2` (Obviously)
4. Road lowered by 14 cm
5. Some additional parameters are provided to gazebo in my implementation which don't exist in `iris_1_roadtextures.world`:

    ```xml
    <physics name="default_physics" default="0" type="ode">

      <magnetic_field>6.0e-6 2.3e-5 -4.2e-5</magnetic_field>
    </physics>
    ```

The major point to note here is that the files available reference deprecated software (refer above) and are not really very easy to manipulate (refer [Creating new models](https://theroboticsclub.github.io/colab-gsoc2019-Nikhil_Khedekar/2019-05-30-creating_new_models/)). The SDF of course can be modified to add cameras directly in it but this is not a viable strategy for any other possible additions in the future. I have [tested the new models](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Nikhil_Khedekar/tree/master/catkin_ws/src/drone_exercises/launch) in the follow_road [world](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2019-Nikhil_Khedekar/tree/master/catkin_ws/src/drone_exercises/worlds) and used them as a basis for fixing the model, world and launch file in the JdeRobot-assets. These changes are available as a [pull request #20](https://github.com/JdeRobot/assets/pull/20).
