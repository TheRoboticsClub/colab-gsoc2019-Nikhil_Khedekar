title: Week 7 - My first (and second) pull request to the official ROS distribution list
---

## Tasks

The tasks for this week were:

1. Porting of three more exercises (This brings us to a total of 5 out of 8). Completed - links below:
    * [Position Control](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/tree/drone_mods/exercises/position_control)
    * [Rescue People](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/tree/drone_mods/exercises/rescue_people)
    * [Visual Lander](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/tree/drone_mods/exercises/visual_lander)
2. Creation of a new `kinetic-devel` branch in the [`assets`](https://github.com/JdeRobot/assets) repository populating it with the required artifacts. This also includes testing it. [Completed](https://github.com/JdeRobot/assets/tree/kinetic-devel)
3. Reorganization of the UI in `rqt_drone_teleop` and the addition of an emergency hover functionality. [Completed](https://github.com/JdeRobot/drones/tree/master/rqt_drone_teleop)
4. Begin continuous integration for the [`drones`](https://github.com/JdeRobot/drones) and [`assets`](https://github.com/JdeRobot/assets) repositories. Completed - [Pull request 1](https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/21805), [Pull request 2](https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/pull/21804)

## Path forward

{: .box-note}
**Note:** We are ahead of the proposed timeline!! :D

With regards to the continuous integration, after the aforementioned pull requests are merged, hopefully within this month, these packages shall be synced after which they shall be available from the official sources as `jderobot-assets`, `drone-wrapper` and `rqt-drone-teleop`. I followed [this turtorial](http://wiki.ros.org/bloom/Tutorials/FirstTimeRelease) on relasing with bloom for the release.

The remaining exercises are a bit complicated than the ones that have already been ported due to the fact that they have multiple agents. But the good thing is that I have more time to do this as we are ahead of schedule!
