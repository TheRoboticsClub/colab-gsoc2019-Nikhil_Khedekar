## The initial commit

Welcome to the progress reports for the GSoC-2019 project titled "Migration of drone excercises to ROS and Jupyter." The reports are planned to be posted per week (atleast). 

The official coding period begins May 27th, but, for the time being, I have started going through the code and excercises at the [Robotics-Academy](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy). 

Since this is my first attempt at writing and maintaining a blog, please do come back at the end of the coding period to notice the overall quality improve with the passage of time :p.
