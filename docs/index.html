<h2>Abstract:</h2>
This GSoC project essentially replaces the existing infrastructure of seven available exercises on drone programming with ROS, PX4 in Gazebo and mavROS. The resultant exercises shall allow users the possibility of directly porting their code onto real drones running PX4 with mavROS. These exercises shall also be integrated into the Jupyter framework for running them from the web release of the Robotics Academy framework.
